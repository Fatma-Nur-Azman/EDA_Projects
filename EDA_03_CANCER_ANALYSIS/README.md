## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Cancer EDA Analytics Project**! This project explores the critical and impactful area of cancer data analysis. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, we uncover trends and insights that can help in understanding cancer patterns. This project is designed for healthcare professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in the epidemiology of cancer.

**TABLE of CONTENTS** 
- UNDERSTANDING THE DATA
- DISTRIBUTIONS
- what is the distribution of the target variable (malignant vs. benign)?
- what are the distributions of the key features (size-shape-texture features)?
- CORRELATIONS
- how do the features correlate with each other?
- what are the relationships between size-related features (radius, area, perimeter)?
- what are the relationships between shape-related features (texture, smoothness, concavity)?
- which features are most correlated in diagnosing malignancy?
- OVERALL CONCLUSION
