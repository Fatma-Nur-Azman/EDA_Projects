## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Kyphosis EDA Analytics Project**! This project delves into the analysis of kyphosis data, a spinal condition that affects the vertebrae. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, we uncover patterns and insights that can aid in understanding kyphosis better. This project is beneficial for healthcare professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in medical data analysis.

**TABLE of CONTENTS** 
- UNDERSTANDING THE DATA
- What are the mean, minimum, and maximum values of the age distribution?
- What is the distribution of vertebra groups?
- How are vertebra groups classified with numerical labels and what are the results of this classification?
- What is the distribution of kyphosis by vertebra groups?
- What is the recurrence status of kyphosis by vertebra number?
- What are the characteristics of the youngest and oldest children?
- CORRELATION ANALYSIS
- What is the relationship between age, number, start data, and kyphosis?
- OVERALL CONCLUSION
